# P3 Progress Log

## Feb. 25, 5:00 AM&#x20;

* Created Github for version control.&#x20;
* Wrote BinaryNode class with getter and setter methods.
  * Not sure if generics are defined correctly yet.
* Wrote skeleton for BinarySearchTreeTester
* Wrote skeleton for BinarySearchTree

\~Time spent: 30min

## Mar. 3, 2:00 AM

* testInsert() method base cases written.
* testSearch() method base cases written.
* testDelete() method base cases written.
* Changed from having a seperate class for the BinaryNode to an internal private class.

Time Spent: \~ 40min, 10%

## Mar. 3, 8:00 PM

* Wrote the insert method using an iteration traversal.
* Wrote preorderPrint() helper method for use in the testing classes.
  * Recursively traverses and appends to a StringBuilder.
* Wrote search() method using an iteration traversal. Tried to do recursive traversal but realized I was making it more complicated than it needed to be.

Time Spent: \~50 min, 50%

## Mar. 3, 9:30 PM

* Wrote delete() method&#x20;
  * &#x20;This took a while to finish, I got stuck once the code got complicated to follow, so I went back to add comments where needed.&#x20;
* wrote inorderRec() method
  * &#x20;This was a pretty simple recursive method.

Time Spent: \~1hr 20 min, 90%

## Mar. 3, 10:30 PM

* Wrote the rest of the test methods for the BinarySearchTree class.
* Wrote kthSmallest() method.
  * Did not 100% finish this method, but it's super close! I had issues with out of bounds indexes.

Time Spent: \~30 min, 100% Done (kinda)

## Mar. 3, 11:55 PM

* Found a typo in the kthSmallest() method that was referencing the object's root instead of the parameter root that was passed in.
  * Everything works now!

Time Spent: 10 min, 100% Done (actually)

## Mar. 4, 1:00 AM

* Fixed some minor bugs in search() method and demonstration.&#x20;
* Started the AVLTree class skeleton.
* Went back and cleaned up and commented on all classes.
*
